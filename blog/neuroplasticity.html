        <h1><center>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</center></h1>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                  Neuroplasticity is the ability of the brain to form and recognize synaptic connections, especially in response to experience and learning, or following an injury. 
                  Growth mindset is the ability to believe that talents can be developed through practice, strategy and hard work. In this blog post we are going to discuss the two, and how they can be used 
                  in everyday life.
            </p>

            <h2>What are some ways to increase neuroplasticity?</h2>
              <br>
              <p>
                A general outline to improving neuroplasticity could be: Begin by selecting an activity that is new: challenging and important to you. Commit to engaging in the exercise as frequently as possible. Eat a healthy diet and regularly connect with others. Some components to think about are: 
                Challenge and novelty, the skill should be new and not too easy. Intention, the skill must have some meaning and importance to you. Specific intention, focusing on exact tasks increases the likelyhood of change. Repetition and intensity, short bouts of intense repetition are usually needed. Time, neuroplasticity takes time to take effect.
              </p>

              <br>
              <h2>How does understanding neuroplasticity benefit us?</h2>
              <br>
              <p>
                By understanding the benefits of neuroplasticity, you are better positioned to be able to implement them in your own life. Just because the principles exist doesnâ€™t mean that we practice them by default. 
                Neuroplasticity is important as we can influence our brains development in positive or negative directions. The more we engage and challenge our mind and body, the longer our brains function at a higher level. And if we understand how we can train our brains, we can use that more in our everyday life. 
                You can check out the ten principles of neuroplasticity <a href="https://www.neuroskills.com/brain-injury/neuroplasticity/ten-principles-of-neuroplasticity/">here!</a>

              <h2>How can you engage in neuroplasticity for your own benefit?</h2>
              <br>
              <p>
                  By reading up on the concepts of neuroplasticity and actively thinking about them in situations that apply to you. For myself I intend to practice more neuroplasticity when practicing the drums. As a professional musician I practice everyday, and am used to examining my playing and planning my practice to 
                  address my weaknesses. I intend to now reflect on neuroplasticity for a few minutes, and think about how the principles can be applied to what I am about to practice. I will also be doing this in my short meditation before I start coding for the day. The great thing about neuroplasticity is that it can be applied 
                  to many different tasks, big and small!

              <h2>What is growth mindset and why is it important?</h2>
              <br>
              <p>
                In a growth mindset people believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work, and intelligence and talent are just a starting point. It is important as it opens us up to the possibility that we can be better if we try, if we tell ourselves we will never improve, 
                or that there is nothing left to learn, then we will not have a base point to start learning from in the first place.
              </p>
              <br>
              <br>
              <h2>Did anything surprise or change for me/how will I integrate a growth mindest into my work?</h2>
              <br>
              <p>
                  I honestly realised that I don't have as much of a growth mindset as I like to think I have. I think it would be very beneficial for me to add in some reflections on the growth mindset to my pre-practice meditations.
              </p>
              <br>
              <br>
              <h2>How will these understandings shape or influence my learning plan?</h2>
              <br>
              <p>
                I think that the best way to take advantage of my understanding of these concepts would be to reflect on them before starting something that requires their use. For example before practicing drums for the day it would be good to get into a growth mindset, 
                and then reflect on the principles of neuroplasticity that might apply to what I am about to practice, such as the appropriate intensity and repetition.
