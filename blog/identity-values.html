              <h1>My Identity and Values</h1>
              <br>
              <p>Hi! In this post I will share with you a bit more about my identity and core values</p>
              <br>
              <h2>My Core Personal Values</h2>
              <br>
              <ul>
                  <li><b>Integrity</b> - Integrity is a big one for me, I believe it's really important to stand by your beliefs, be it a t-shirt you thought looked cool or a moral situation worthy of an RPG. Which leads into... </li>
                  <br>
                  <li><b>Open-mindedness</b> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs60CqBYnvg">Succinct</a>, as important as I think it is to stand by your values, I think it's just as important to be open to changing said values</li>
                  <br>
                  <li><b>Humour</b> - Because why not?</li>
                  <br>
                  <li><b>Artistic expression</b> - As a musician, artistic expression as very important to me and has been a core part of my life for many years, and hopefully many more to come</li> 
                  <br>
                  <li><b>Critical thinking</b> - In my work as a musician I have found tremendous value in being able to reflect on my playing as well as others, both the good parts and the bad parts
                  I believe it's necessary for growth and improvement in good and bad parts of my work even if it's hard to acknowledge sometimes.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
            <p>I think growing up in a rural area has affected my values as you have to have a certain degree of self sufficiency.  If you have issues there may not be anyone around to help you solve them so you have to be ready and able to at least try. 
                There is a negative stereotype of rural people as being “just get on with it, don’t cry and whinge” and other similar sentiments. 
                While this can been seen as negative, there is a positive aspect to it in the sense of facing up to challenges and getting on with things. An example of this was growing up rurally, you had to get your license to drive ASAP if you wanted any kind of freedom. 
                It was a bit of a shock to meet new friends who lived in Christchurch who to this day have never gotten their license.
                <br>
                Another thing that I think has effected my values was going to study music. The school was a real melting pot of people from different backgrounds and was a much more intimate study setting than university. Everyone knew everyone and you really had to learn to work well together, 
                especially as you would play together for assessments and your success depended on their success. It took me a while to get used to collaborating with lots of different people every day like that but it was a really good skill for me to learn, and one that I want to continue developing.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>My Strengths and Limitations</h2>
            <br>
            <p>A strength of mine that I found while studying music was self discipline. To succeed at the music school you really had to practice a lot in your spare time. I would often practice for over 4 hours a day which could be very gruelling. I still practice at least an hour most days. 
                I think this self discipline will be very useful along this self study journey.
                <br>
                <br>
                Another strength I found in music was collaborating with others. I always let MDs and other musicians know I am open to criticism or changes to my playing if they want something different for the music, and I won’t get vibey about it. 
                I know from experience that a lot of musicians can get very upset if you make any kind of comment about their playing, even positive, and that’s not how I want to work. If there is a lot of tension when playing together it’s not fun.    
                <br>
                <br>
                A big weakness I have is self promotion. I have found it very hard to stand by my work and be confident that it is up to professional standards, especially as I have very high standards for myself (another weakness). 
                I feel like this has definitely held me back in my music career and else where, as self promotion is very important.
                <br>
                <br>
                Another thing that I see as both a strength and weakness in myself is my perfectionism. On the one hand I think it’s a strength as it means I aim for high standards. 
                But it’s also a weakness as it means that I often don’t achieve those standards which can prevent me from progressing further.
