        <h1><center>EQ and IQ</center></h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>I’m sure you’ve heard of IQ before, it comes up a lot. “I’m taking an IQ test”, “I have an IQ of 200”, “you really have to have a high IQ to get Rick and Morty….”. But what about EQ?</p>
        <br>
        <h2>What is emotional intelligence?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Emotional intelligence, EQ, is related to your ability to sense emotion in others and yourself. It also includes how you use that awareness to guide your behaviour. According to Daniel Goleman, a psychologist who helped popularise the concept, there are five key elements to emotional intelligence.</p>
        <br>
        <li><b>Self awareness</b> - being self aware means you always know how you feel, and how your emotions and actions affect those around you. It also involves having a clear picture of your strengths and weaknesses, and acting with humility.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Self regulation</b> - self regulation is more or less self control, people with good self regulation rarely make rushed or emotional decisions, verbally abuse others, compromise their values or engage in stereotyping people.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Motivation</b> - self motivated people consistently work towards their goals and set extremely high standards for their work.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Empathy</b> - People with good empathy can read others emotions and see things from their point of view and understand why they feel that way.</li>
        <br> 
        <li><b>Social skills</b> people with good social skills are effective communicators and are great at getting others to effectively empathise with them. They are good at leading groups, resolving conflicts and ranging changes.</li>
        <br>
        <h2>How is EQ different to IQ?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>IQ generally refers to your intellectual ability and includes aspects like using logic to solve problems, planning and strategy, understanding abstract ideas and adapting to change. Emotional intelligence, as we explored above, 
            refers more to understanding the emotions of yourself and others. If we used a web development company as an example, a person with a high IQ might be good at writing code, debugging code and testing/planning the creation of the website. A person with good emotional intelligence might be good at interacting with team members, 
            coordinating projects, pitching ideas, understanding development issues and interacting with clients.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Why is EQ so important?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>EQ is important because it focusses on people skills that aren’t directly included under the IQ umbrella. While IQ is important for success through problem solving, EQ is important for situations that require skills like building and maintaining relationships, collaboration, communication and conflict resolution.
             It is hard to say whether or not one is more important than the other and it will vary as to which is more helpful depending on the situation, but if you can work on using both EQ and IQ combined you might see a big improvement in yourself and your work!</p>
