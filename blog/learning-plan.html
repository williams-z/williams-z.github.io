        <h1><center>My Learning Plan - Foundations</h1></center></h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Read on for my learning plan throughout the stages of the DevAcademy journey.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>What is my long term goal and/or career plan?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>I would like to be able to put the ideas I have in my head onto the webpage with ease, and if I can’t do it I’d like to be able to have the know-how to search for the answers. 
            If you don’t know the question, how can you find the answer? In terms of long term career I’d like to be able to pick and choose the work I do, and have a good work/life balance. I’d like to be a web-dev by day and a musician by night, 
            and if I could use my web dev skills in some area of music, like making webpages for artists, that would be really cool!
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>What are my strengths and limitations?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>You can read about some of my strengths and limitations on my identity and values page <a href="identity-values.html">here.</a> (Showing off some linking skills so I dont have to type them again)</p>
        <br>
        <h2>What human skills would I like to develop?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>I would like to be able to put myself out there more and have the confidence to show my ideas and work, even if it’s not finished or at a standard that I’d like it to be. I would also like to improve my collaboration skills, 
            in the sense of pitching my ideas to my peers if I feel like they might be valid.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>What is my commitment to how I will manage my workload during this program?</h2>  
        <br>
        <p>I will manage my workload by trying to follow the recommended time boxes. If I feel like I am able to understand an exercise,  or if I am able to finish a non technical exercise fast I may move on early. 
            If I feel I need longer on the learning and coding aspects, I would like to add a relatively small amount of time to make certain I understand the concepts. I will also be sure to take regular breaks to avoid getting burned out. I am used to working with others and do not feel that it is a human skill I need to develop, 
            however if any issues do arise I will contact the appropriate facilitators. I will make sure to treat everyone’s contributions equally and and only make valid and relevant comments and criticism.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>My commitment as to how and where I will seek help in a timely way</h2>
        <br>
        <p>I would start by using the slack channel if appropriate, such as for things like understanding a task or finding help with code etc. If I still can’t get the help I need I will reach out to my facilitator.

          For non course related trouble I have my family for help and support who are there for me at all times. If something is starting to effect my course work I will let my facilitator know as soon as possible.
          </p>     
        <br>
        <h2>What do I expect from the facilitator team></h2>
        <br>
        <p>I expect help and support in a reasonable amount of time during working hours. I expect them to be able to explain concepts and how they relate in a way that students can understand them. </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Any scheduling information?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Not at this time but if anything comes upthat might affect things I'll be sure to let the appropriate people know.</p>
        <br>
        <h1><center>My Learning Plan - Bootcamp</center></h1>
        <br>
        <h2>What is my long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          I am still unsure exactly where I would like to use the skills that I will learn. I would still like to become capable enough to be able to solve problems quickly and efficiently, 
          and be able to execute the ideas in my head on the screen.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>What do I think my biggest strengths and limitations will be in the bootcamp?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          I think my problem solving will be one of my strengths. But I still have very much to learn and understand despite what I have already learned in foundations.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>What do I think my biggest non-technical challenge will be at bootcamp?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          I think it will be challenging to keep on top of the material and my side of the workload. I will hope to have my time management under control so I can stay on top of my workload. Otherwise I am fairly confident in working with groups and presenting in front of them.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>What human skills would I like to develop during bootcamp?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          I would still like to develop the skills I talked about in my foundations learning plan. I would like to be able to put myself out there more and have the confidence to show my ideas and work, even if it’s not finished or at a standard that I’d like it to be. I would also like to improve my collaboration skills, 
          in the sense of pitching my ideas to my peers if I feel like they might be valid. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>What are my expectations from the bootcamp team?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          I hope that the bootcamp team explain concepts in a way that is understandable and related to what we are learning. I also hope they are available to help when needed and explain what to do in an understandable way, rather than "just do this". 
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>What are my expectations of myself during bootcamp?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          I will manage my time appropriatly and complete my tasks on time. I will also listen to others in my team and provide help where I can and ask for help when I need it. I will try to follow best-practice standards and keep my work to a high standard. I will also try to stay in my growth mindset as best as I can, as I have found that that is where I produce my best work and have my best attitude!
