        <h1><center>My Final Reflections</center></h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            Time to share some final reflections from the foundations!
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            <b>1 - </b>I find it hard to ask for help when I think I need it. Not in the sense that I don’t want help but I don’t like to bother others, 
            and I also have a bit of pride around asking for help. It is only when I get to a point where I cannot progress at all do I ask, which is good in the context of this course as it encourages me to research, 
            but I feel like creating that dialogue is also something I should get used to.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>2 - </b>I still have trouble getting into the developer mindset. I feel like this one might just come with more time though. I hope that the more things I work on, the better I will get.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>3 - </b>I should stay in my growth mindset. When I learned about growth mindset more and tried to consciously apply it I found I worked from a better headspace. I still need to work in staying in that mindset but when I can it is really good.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>What are the roles of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            I think being aware of these things allow you to be aware of how complex programming can be. Considering that you will often be working in teams it is very important to keep the team vibe good and work well together, 
            and that complexity could easily create tension. Knowing about yourself and others will help the group function well together and work at full potential, and keep the work vibe good.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            How much I would appreciate it. I thought that it would be pointless but I really found myself agreeing with and applying the things I learnt, especially about my own mindset. I really found it helpful with my learning and can understand why it is important to teach it now.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of core learning?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            Reflecting on myself and my values honestly. It’s always been something that I have struggled with and am still struggling with.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Why do you think we focus so much on core learning?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            Because people can be great at something objectively, but if they are hard to work with it doesn’t matter. It is something I have seen in the music industry fairly often where someone is a great player, 
            but they are incredibly difficult to work with and it stops them from getting as much work as they potentially could. Having experienced that I completely understand why it is taught.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning fell like a waste of time?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            No. I think it’s very important to know these things for the reason stated in the answer above. And in my own experience it is hard to reflect on these things by yourself without prompt. 
            I feel like I reflected about a lot of aspects of my learning and working style that I would not have otherwise thought about.
