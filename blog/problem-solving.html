              <h2>The Rubber Ducky Method</h2>
              <br>
              <p>
                  First off, we will discuss a problem solving technique that was new to me, but is very helpful. 
                  Rubber ducky debugging is a method of finding that bug preventing your software from running. 
                  It comes from a story of how a programmer would bring a rubber duck with them and debug code by explaining how it works, line by line, to that duck. 
                  Many software engineers have found that by explaining their code aloud they unexpectedly find solutions to errors that they previously didn’t consider. 
                  When you hit roadblocks in programming, it’s likely that you are not thinking in the painfully precise way that a computer does. Many of the bugs and issues you encounter in your programming originate in not being clear and explicit in your instructions.
                  <br>
                  <br>  
                  By walking through a problem out loud, your brain is forced to slow down its thinking as we literally cannot verbalise our problems as fast as we can read or think about them. 
                  It also means that instead of skim reading code, we have to analyse every piece of information until we find the bug. Also, you are forced to explain every piece of information to your ‘duck’, 
                  just like a computer needs every piece of information spelled out to them.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  So, how do we use the rubber ducky method?
                  <br>
                  <br>
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>- Find your rubber ducky</li>
                <br>
                <li>- Start explaining your code and its goals, setting the context for the duck.</li>
                <br>
                <li>- This is where you move into details — don’t skip them. Start going through line-by-line, the flow of the whole function or method that isn’t working.</li> 
                <br>
                <li>- Then move onto all the intermediate states and transitions.</li>
                <br>
                <li>- You’ll stumble upon the solution! Whether it was a typo, the condition, or something else, you’re bound to find it by walking through the process.</li>
              </ol>
              <br>
              <br>
              <h2>My problem solving experience.</h2>
              <br>
              <p>
                  Now I'm going to tell you about a time I got blocked on a simple problem. During the FizzBuzz kata I got stuck believing I had the right answer but it wouldn't work. 
                  FizzBuzz is a simple function that in simple terms replaces certain numbers from a group of numbers given, with the words 'Fizz' or 'Buzz' depending on the number. 
                  Because of the simplicity of the function I was sure I had the right answer but could not pass the tests given. I solved the problem by using the rubber ducky method, 
                  and quickly found that I had a word in the wrong place.
              </p>
              <br>
              <br>
              <h2>My reflections on how confident I am with problem solving techniques.</h2>
              <br>
              <p>
                  <b>Psuedocode</b> - I feel pretty confident using psuedocode as a general outline, but I still find it hard to know more specifics about what a section of code might need to do in order to work.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Trying something</b> - I will use this technique quite often, but sometimes I find it easy to go down the rabbit hole of trying solutions but not getting anywhere.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Rubber ducky method</b> - I am quite new to rubber ducky method, I have found it very useful in some occasions. I will be trying to use it more in future.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Reading error messages</b> - I always read error messages as a starting point when something isn't working. Sometimes I find them hard to decipher though.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Console.logging</b> - Console logging is a technique I use all the time, even when there are no errors yet. I like to be able to see what is happening to my code as a do different things with it. I sometimes find it hard to know where to put a console log for it to be the most helpful.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Googling</b> - Googling solutions is another technique I use very often, I am quite confident in wording my questions to find what I need. Sometimes it is hard to find a solution that fits what I need, and I find it hard to adapt solutions that are close but not the same as what I need.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Asking peers</b> - I find it quite hard to ask others for help as I don't like to disrupt their work. It is definitely an area I might need to improve in.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Asking coaches for help</b> - I have asked my facilitator a few times for help when I am stuck on something. I'd like to be able to work more independently though.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Improving my process with reflection</b> - This is one I definitly need to work on. I am pretty bad at flecting on my coding work.
